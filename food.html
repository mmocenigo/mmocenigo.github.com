<strong><a href="http://www.aliveandkickinglobsters.com/" target="_blank">Alive & Kicking Lobsters</a></strong><br>
<em>296 Putnam Ave, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>This place is a tiny hole-in-the-wall nestled into the heart of residential Cambridge. Their menu is limited, and the only seating can be found at a couple picnic tables outside, but their lobster salad sandwich is perhaps one of the best interpretations of a lobster roll. You will get huge chunks of lobster meat, with light mayo, sandwiched between delicious, buttered, toasted bread, all with the astonishingly affordable price tag of $13.95. I love these so much that I usually get two.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.allstarsandwichbar.com/" target="_blank">All Star Sandwich Bar</a></strong><br>
<em>1245 Cambridge St, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>This is a great lunch stop for greasy, above-average sandwiches. They whip up some interesting combinations, with a number of choices that include spicier components, but they also have the standards, such as a reuben, BLT, or turkey club.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.ballsquarecafe.com/" target="_blank">Ball Sq Cafe</a></strong><br>
<em>708 Broadway, Somerville</em><br>
<p>This is another brunch place that sees quite a crowd on weekends. It has some sort of ongoing rivalry with the neighboring Soundbites, so that seems to cut the crowd a bit. There's nothing particularly unique or different on the menu; it's your standard breakfast assortment of pancakes, waffles, eggs benedict, omelettes, etc. However, the food is consistently good.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://bin26.com/" target="_blank">Bin 26 Enoteca</a></strong><br>
<em>26 Charles St, Boston</em><br>
<p>Having been raised in an Italian family with frequent visits to Italy, I have very high standards for my Italian food. I usually maintain a policy of avoiding Italian restaurants due to my long history of disappointment. My friend and I ended up here while trying to find a lunch compromise after a morning of shopping in Beacon Hill. We happened to catch the tail-end of brunch, which was so spectacular that we immediately made reservations for dinner. Now, when I have to eat the abomination of American-Italian cuisine, the one thing I always avoid is gnocchi. My grandmother made gnocchi that was light and fluffy; not like the tiny pebbles that frequently grace American menus. However, when my friend ordered the gnocchi, I was so impressed that it is now my go-to dish when I eat here. I have yet to have an unpleasant meal here, and the extensive wine list means I will always have new wines to try too!</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.theblueroom.net/" target="_blank">The Blue Room</a></strong><br>
<em>1 Kendall Sq, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>My ideal brunch place is the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia, but this has been my favorite brunch in the Boston area. It can seem a bit steep to shell out $27 + tip for a brunch, but it is a great value for the all-you-can-eat buffet. I found the desserts a bit underwhelming, but I found plenty to love on the buffet proper. The savory brunch menu is absolutely mouth-watering!</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.bondircambridge.com/" target="_blank">Bondir</a></strong><br>
<em>279a Broadway, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>Bondir is tiny, which makes it feel a bit more like dining in someone's very lovely country home. Each of the dishes demonstrate some sort of innovative flourish, and they are all executed well. The option for a half portion is a great way to sample a couple different dishes because it's really hard to choose just one. It's well worth the price tag, but be prepared to make reservations in advance.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://christinasicecream.com/" target="_blank">Christina's Ice Cream</a></strong><br>
<em>1255 Cambridge St, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>The ice cream here can run a bit pricey for what you're getting; plus it's cash only. However, in terms of flavor, I think this is the best ice cream in Cambridge. It's always fresh, rich, and creamy. The selection of flavors is simple yet unique.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.cloverfoodlab.com/" target="_blank">Clover</a></strong><br>
<em>Multiple Locations, Food Truck</em><br>
<p>I am not a vegetarian at all, but I used to get very excited to go to Clover. The employees are incredibly friendly and helpful, the service is efficient, and the atmosphere (even at the food trucks) is trendy and modern. However, despite a few seasonal items, there are not many changes to the core menu, and once you've tried these items there's nowhere else to go.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.craigieonmain.com/" target="_blank">Craigie on Main</a></strong><br>
<em>853 Main St, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>It's really easy to get carried away and spend a fortune. Some of the fare here reminded to of Fergus Henderson's nose-to-tail restaurant St. John. A lot of care has gone into the preparation of every dish, and this is completely reflected in the flavors. There's also a fabulous wine selection and decent cocktails. I've also heard excellent things about their burger and fully intend to return.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://eastcoastgrill.net/" target="_blank">East Coast Grill</a></strong><br>
<em>1271 Cambridge St, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>East Coast Grill is often highly lauded for its seafood, and many people will recognize it for its Hell Night, as featured on Man vs Food. They do have an excellent raw bar, but I find that the seafood dishes are often over-spiced and the simple, subtle flavors of the fish are lost. However, Hell Night here is quite an experience and worth trying once if you are a fan of spicy food, but even the wimp's menu has a bit of a kick!</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.easternstandardboston.com/" target="_blank">Eastern Standard</a></strong><br>
<em>528 Commonwealth Ave, Boston</em><br>
<p>This place is a great blend of delicious food and delightful cocktails. If I lived closer, this would surely be a favorite.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.flourbakery.com/" target="_blank">Flour Bakery</a></strong><br>
<em>Multiple Locations</em><br>
<p>Everyone raves about their sticky buns, but frankly, I come here for their sandwiches. The roasted lamb with goat cheese and tomato chutney is perhaps the best sandwich I've ever eaten; the delicious baked goods are just a bonus! Their drink selection is pretty limited and underwhelming.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.thefriendlytoast.net/" target="_blank">The Friendly Toast</a></strong><br>
<em>1 Hampshire St, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>This seems to be a Cambridge favorite. Every Sunday morning, diners will compete with a crowd of hungover students to get a table, and it's not uncommon to wait more than an hour for a table. The breakfast food is good, but it's pretty much a half step up from classic diner fare. The eclectic kitsch and friendly waitstaff keep me coming back, but I don't think the food is worth it during the particularly busy weekend hours.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://hi-risebread.com/" target="_blank">Hi-Rise Bread Co.</a></strong><br>
<em>Multiple Locations</em><br>
<p>My mom's recent breakfast obsession has been granola, and she loves the granola at Hi-Rise so much that she demands I ship it to her in bulk. Consequently, I've had a chance to sample some of their baked goods during my granola trips, and I love their products. I'd say their quality is on par with Flour, but I vastly prefer their selection. Unfortunately, their two locations are just off the major public transit stops and are far enough to be a bit inconvenient, so I only end up here for special trips.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.hungrymothercambridge.com/" target="_blank">Hungry Mother</a></strong><br>
<em>233 Cardinal Medeiros Ave, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>This quickly became a staple for family visits and is an all-around favorite. I never believed true southern food could be this classy, but the chef here has managed to add his own twist to old favorites, like catfish and cornbread; in fact, the sorghum butter with the cornbread has made a couple guest appearances in my food dreams. The cocktails are also good, when I can resist the bottomless sweet tea.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.mrbartley.com/" target="_blank">Mr Bartley's Burger Cottage</a></strong><br>
<em>1246 Mass Ave, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>I would not recommend this place for their burgers; they run about $10+, and except for some cool topping combos, there is nothing special about them, especially not ten-dollars-special. However, people come here for the atmosphere. It's a brusque, cash-only dive with all the kitsch one could hope for in a local landmark. It can be fun with tourist friends who don't particularly care about spending $10+ on a subpar burger.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.oleanarestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Oleana</a></strong><br>
<em>134 Hampshire St, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>I really want to go back here because I did not get to try half the items I wanted. Everything was good, but only a couple of the dishes I tried were truly exciting.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.roxysgrilledcheese.com/" target="_blank">Roxy's Grilled Cheese</a></strong><br>
<em>Food Truck</em><br>
<p>They have a great selection of grilled cheese and quite a number of accolades behind them; however, I find that the grilled cheese can occasionally be a bit too greasy.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.eatfrites.com/" target="_blank">Saus</a></strong><br>
<em>33 Union St, Boston</em><br>
<p>They have a whole menu of Belgian 'street food', which I'll explore once I can resist their waffles long enough to try something else. I did try the frites, which were good, and the sauce selection is actually pretty close to what I saw in Belgium; however, once I tried the waffles (with salted caramel sauce), it has become a constant craving.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://staffmealboston.com/" target="_blank">Staff Meal</a></strong><br>
<em>Food Truck</em><br>
<p>This is my favorite food truck in the Boston area. I still dream about their housemade chorizo taco with lime crema.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.tosci.com/" target="_blank">Toscanini's</a></strong><br>
<em>899 Main St, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>This is another pricey place for ice cream, but it's easy to understand why once you've seen the menu; they experiment with a bunch of completely unique flavor combinations. For me, this is both a benefit and, well, not. The flavors can quickly become overwhelming, even in small quantities, so it's important to choose carefully. Perhaps the sample of burnt caramel is delicious but a whole cup begins to taste just, well, burnt.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://yankeelobstercompany.com/" target="_blank">Yankee Lobster</a></strong><br>
<em>300 Northern Ave, Boston</em><br>
<p>This is where I bring friends to see the 'real Boston', usually after a tour of Harpoon Brewery next door. This place is simple and completely unpretentious. They have an extensive menu of some of the best seafood New England can offer for reasonable market prices; if you can dream it, they will batter and fry it. Their clam chowder and lobster bisque are hearty, flavorful, and full of seafood chunks.</p>
</address>

<h3>Drinks</h3>

<address>
<strong>Brick & Mortar</strong><br>
<em>569 Mass Ave, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>This has slowly replaced Drink as my primary cocktail bar. Perhaps it's the proximity to my home or that it's less popular than Drink, but I've since had some of my best cocktails here and some of the best service. The price is a dollar or so cheaper per drink. Like Drink, the food menu is pretty limited, but what they have is consistently delicious.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://drinkfortpoint.com/" target="_blank">Drink</a></strong><br>
<em>348 Congress St, Boston</em><br>
<p>Personally, I'm a big believer in everything Barbara Lynch touches, and Drink is no exception. When I first discovered this place, I came here every weekend for a month and a half. Since there's no menu and drinks are ordered through a Q&A with the bartender, I was able to explore cocktails I'd never have considered previously. This place is responsible for my identity as a consumer of find spirits.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://themeadhall.com/" target="_blank">Meadhall</a></strong><br>
<em>4 Cambridge Center, Cambridge</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't go here for a meal, and I find that the bar itself doesn't have a lot of character; however, their beer selection makes up for any other shortcomings. They have around 100 beers on tap, and the menu is well-organized to find something to your taste.</p>

<strong><a href="http://www.10greekstreet.com/" target="_blank">10 Greek Street</a></strong><br>
<em>10 Greek Street W1D 4DH</em><br>
<p>This was highly recommended by our excellent waiter at The Ledbury. We didn't have a chance to try it, but he promised good food and a killer wine list.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.beasofbloomsbury.com/" target="_blank">Bea's of Bloomsbury</a></strong><br>
<em>Multiple Locations</em><br>
<p>These are the best cupcakes you'll ever eat. Ever. They also do a fabulous afternoon tea. Make sure to try their scones and clotted cream too.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.boroughmarket.org.uk/" target="_blank">Borough Market</a></strong><br>
<em>151 Borough High Street SE1 1HR</em><br>
<p>The Borough Market is an experience. It's one of the more touristy food markets, but it's earned its fame. There are three sections to this market, so come hungry and walk around before getting something.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.foxandanchor.com/" target="_blank">Fox & Anchor</a></strong><br>
<em>115 Charterhouse Street EC1M 6AA</em><br>
<p>This touts itself as a gastropub, and it really is the right mix of ye olde pub and ye delicious food.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong>The Golden Hind</strong><br>
<em>73 Marylebone Lane W1U 2PN</em><br>
<p>This is often lauded as the best fish n' chips in London, but I've never been. It has slightly odd hours, and it's a bit out of the way in Marylebone.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.theledbury.com/" target="_blank">The Ledbury</a></strong><br>
<em>127 Ledbury Road W11 2AQ</em><br>
<p>One-of-a-kind dining experience and totally worth the trip to Notting Hill (combine it with a day at Portobello Road!). Set price lunch menu is affordable, but you'll be very tempted to go a la carte once you see the menu. Everything is phenomenal. Phenomenal. And if they give you a choice of bread, TRY THE BACON BRIOCHE.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://maltbystmarket.com/" target="_blank">Maltby Street Market</a></strong><br>
<em>Druid Street, Maltby Street SE1</em><br>
<p>Both St John and Bea's have locations at this Saturday morning market. St John Bakery offers the best cream-filled donuts ever, and right next door, Bea's offers a selection of excellent breakfast items.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong>Rock & Sole Plaice</strong><br>
<em>47 Endell Street WC2H 9AJ</em><br>
<p>This is my favorite fish n' chips place. Make sure to get takeaway; eating in will tack on a hefty sum to the already-steep price, and the service is brusque... but this is genuine, quality fish n' chips. Oh, and ask them to salt and malt your fries because Americans just can't get it right.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.rules.co.uk/" target="_blank">Rules</a></strong><br>
<em>35 Maiden Lane WC2E 7LB</em><br>
<p>This was my uncle's favorite restaurant when he lived in London. It's a good pre-theater option, and it feels like an old gentleman's club from the Victorian times. It has a broad (slightly pricey) menu of game meats. It's solid British food, if a bit touristy.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.smithsofsmithfield.co.uk/" target="_blank">Smiths of Smithfield</a></strong><br>
<em>66-77 Charterhouse Street EC1M 6HJ</em><br>
<p>The best full English breakfast in London! You probably won't be hungry for the rest of the day, but it's obligatory to try.
Bacon, egg (any style), beans, sausage, mushrooms, black pudding, tomato, beans, bubble (sort of like a hash brown), and toast</p>
</address>

<h3>Drinks</h3>

<address>
<strong><a href="" target="_blank">Ye Olde Mitre</a></strong><br>
<em>1 Ely Court  EC1N 6SJ</em><br>
<em>Type: Fuller's</em><br>
<p>This is a popular after-work pub, and it can get a bit crowded. It's hidden down a tiny alley way and is considered one of the hardest to find. It's also one of the oldest pubs in London; the building was constructed in 1546 to provide a drinking establishment for servants at the Palace. It also serves some really classic pub food, like toasties and Scotch eggs.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="" target="_blank">Cittie of Yorke</a></strong><br>
<em>22 High Holborn WC1V 6BN</em><br>
<em>Type: Sam Smith's</em><br>
<p>This is another popular after-work, historic pub. It has been a pub since 1430 although it has undergone minor renovations since then. It's got less of a cozy atmosphere than Mitre, but it has more space and slightly better drinks.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://shipandshovell.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ship & Shovell</a></strong><br>
<em>1-3 Craven Passage WC2N 5PH</em><br>
<em>Type: Free House</em><br>
<p>Serves a good variety of local craft-brewed ales, usually Badger.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.eustontap.com/" target="_blank">Euston Tap</a></strong><br>
<em>190 Euston Road NW1 2EF</em><br>
<em>Type: Free House</em><br>
<p>It's really not worth the extra trip, but if you're stuck at Euston, this is a great little place to pop in for a drink. It has a huge variety of craft ale. It's located in what appears to be an old gatehouse leading into Euston Station; its associated cider bar is in the opposite gatehouse.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://www.happinessforgets.com/" target="_blank">Happiness Forgets</a></strong><br>
<em>8-9 Hoxton Square N1 6NU</em><br>
<em>Type: Cocktails</em><br>
<p>This has beaten out Drink for my favorite cocktail bar ever. It's a bit hard to find. It's in the basement of 8 Hoxton Square, but the steps are outside. It's really worth it. The Canadian bartender, Geoff, makes a fantastic drink with mezcal, fernet, and maple syrup called The Gastown.</p>
</address>

<address>
<strong><a href="http://purl-london.com/" target="_blank">Purl</a></strong><br>
<em>50-54 Blandford Street W1U 7HX</em><br>
<em>Type: Cocktails</em><br>
<p>I wanted to go here so badly, but we ran out of time. You may want to make a reservation because there is no bar, only tables. They don't serve food, but it seems they do some cool chemistry-esque things with the drink-making. Some cocktails are reasonably priced (comparatively), and everything looks good.</p>
